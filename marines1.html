Marine Drive, officially known as Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose Marg, is a 3 kilometre long boulevard which stretches from Nariman Point to Malabar Hills. <br> It is an inverted 'C'-shaped six lane road in southern Mumbai, running along the coast of the Arabian Sea. <br> Famed for a large number of Art Deco buildings that were built by wealthy Parsis during the early 20th century, this necklace-shaped stretch is worth exploring.<br> Listed among the most posh areas of the city, Marine Drive features many high-end hotels and restaurants.
<br>
Towards the north of Marine Drive is the popular Chowpatty Beach. <br> At night, with the street lights are on, the entire road appears like a dazzling diamond neckpiece, hence its also referred as 'Queen's Necklace'. <br> The highlight of this place is the beautiful promenade, which is lined with several palm trees. <br> Considered as one of world's largest viewing gallery, Marine Drive attracts millions of tourists every year.
