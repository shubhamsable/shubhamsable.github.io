<br>Hanging Gardens, also referred as Pherozeshah Mehta Gardens, are beautiful terraced gardens that are set atop the western side of Malabar Hill. Established in the 1880s, this garden was designed by Ulhas Ghapokar to protect a nearby water reservoir from getting polluted. 
<br>
This painstakingly manicured garden is spread in a vast area that has well-laid pathways. The colourful flower clock at the centre and numerous animal-shaped hedges are the unique features of this park. You can also enjoy spectacular views of the Arabian Sea from the Hanging Gardens. 
<br>
The Boot House or Old Woman's Shoe, completely made up of stone, is another interesting feature that would make your visit a memorable one. Whether with family or alone, visitors will definitely have a great time amidst the serene surroundings of these beautiful gardens. Its well-maintained pathways are perfect for a jog or stroll around the park
